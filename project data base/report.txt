Smart Farm Project:

The "Smart Farm" project is a database management system designed to support a modern, technology-driven agricultural environment. The aim is to monitor soil conditions, temperature, and water needs using sensors connected to different devices managed by farm users. These readings can trigger alerts when certain thresholds are exceeded, enabling efficient water management and improved crop yield.

The system tracks:

Users managing farms

Devices and sensors installed on farms

Real-time sensor data (temperature, soil moisture, etc.)

Alerts based on sensor readings
